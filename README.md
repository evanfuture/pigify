# Pigify
This is a solution to a common developer-test, namely create a script that takes an string as input and spits out Pig Latin-ized text.  My implementation needed some pretty effects, and I like to show off, so I'm also using Prism.js for showcasing the code.
If you want to use it on your own server for some reason, just clone the repo and run '''npm install && bower install && gulp'''
